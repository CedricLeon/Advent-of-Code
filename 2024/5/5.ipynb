    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The `topological_sort()` function is used to reorder the pages in each update so that they respect the ordering rules provided. If the pages can be rearranged to satisfy all the rules without conflicts, the function returns the reordered list. If not, it returns `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This rearrangement is necessary because some updates originally violate the ordering rules. By reordering them, we can include them in our calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Topological Sorting?\n",
    "\n",
    "Topological sorting is a method used in computer science to linearly order the nodes of a **directed acyclic graph (DAG)** such that for every directed edge from node A to node B, node A comes before node B in the ordering.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simpler terms, if you have a set of tasks with dependencies (some tasks must be done before others), topological sorting gives you an order to perform the tasks without violating any dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding the `topological_sort()` Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a step-by-step explanation of what the `topological_sort()` function does:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Build the Graph**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Nodes**: Each page number in the update is a node in the graph.\n",
    "   - **Edges**: An edge from page X to page Y means page X must come before page Y (based on the ordering rules).\n",
    "   - **Graph Representation**: We use a dictionary (`graph`) to represent the adjacency list of the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Initialize Indegrees**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Indegree**: The number of edges coming into a node.\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Indegrees help us identify nodes with no dependencies (`indegree` of zero), which can be placed at the beginning of the ordering.\n",
    "   - We initialize a dictionary (`indegree`) with all pages having an indegree of zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Populate the Graph and Indegrees**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - We iterate over all ordering rules that involve pages in the current update.\n",
    "   - **For each rule (X must come before Y)**:\n",
    "     - Add Y to the list of adjacent nodes for X in the graph (`graph[X].append(Y)`).\n",
    "     - Increment the indegree of Y (`indegree[Y] += 1`), because there's one more page that must come before Y.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Initialize the Processing Queue**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - We create a queue (`queue`) of all nodes with an indegree of zero. These are the pages with no prerequisites and can be placed first in the ordering.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Process the Nodes**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - We initialize an empty list (`sorted_pages`) to store the pages in the correct order.\n",
    "   - **While the queue is not empty**:\n",
    "     - Remove a page (`u`) from the front of the queue.\n",
    "     - Add `u` to `sorted_pages`.\n",
    "     - For each page (`v`) that comes after `u` (i.e., `for v in graph[u]`):\n",
    "       - Decrement the indegree of `v` (`indegree[v] -= 1`).\n",
    "       - If `indegree[v]` becomes zero, add `v` to the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Check for Cycles**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - After processing all nodes:\n",
    "     - If the length of `sorted_pages` is less than the number of pages in the update, it means there is a cycle (conflict) in the ordering rules, and it's impossible to sort the pages without violating the rules.\n",
    "     - In this case, the function returns `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Return the Sorted Pages**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - If no cycles are detected, the function returns `sorted_pages`, which is a valid ordering of the pages according to the ordering rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simplified Explanation with an Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a simple update with pages `[1, 2, 3]` and ordering rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `1|2`: Page 1 must come before page 2.\n",
    "- `2|3`: Page 2 must come before page 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step-by-Step Execution**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Build the Graph and Indegrees**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Graph**:\n",
    "     - `graph[1] = [2]`\n",
    "     - `graph[2] = [3]`\n",
    "   - **Indegrees**:\n",
    "     - `indegree[1] = 0` (no pages must come before page 1)\n",
    "     - `indegree[2] = 1` (page 1 must come before page 2)\n",
    "     - `indegree[3] = 1` (page 2 must come before page 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Initialize the Queue**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Pages with `indegree` zero: `[1]`\n",
    "   - `queue = deque([1])`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Process the Nodes**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Process Page 1**:\n",
    "     - Remove `1` from the queue.\n",
    "     - Add `1` to `sorted_pages`: `[1]`\n",
    "     - For `v` in `graph[1]` (which is `[2]`):\n",
    "       - Decrement `indegree[2]` to `0`.\n",
    "       - Add `2` to the queue.\n",
    "   - **Process Page 2**:\n",
    "     - Remove `2` from the queue.\n",
    "     - Add `2` to `sorted_pages`: `[1, 2]`\n",
    "     - For `v` in `graph[2]` (which is `[3]`):\n",
    "       - Decrement `indegree[3]` to `0`.\n",
    "       - Add `3` to the queue.\n",
    "   - **Process Page 3**:\n",
    "     - Remove `3` from the queue.\n",
    "     - Add `3` to `sorted_pages`: `[1, 2, 3]`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Check for Cycles**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The length of `sorted_pages` is 3, which matches the number of pages.\n",
    "   - No cycles detected.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Return the Sorted Pages**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The function returns `[1, 2, 3]`, a valid ordering.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling Conflicts (Cycles)\n",
    "\n",
    "If there's a circular dependency, like `1|2` and `2|1`, it creates a cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example with Conflict**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pages: `[1, 2]`\n",
    "- Ordering Rules:\n",
    "  - `1|2`: Page 1 must come before page 2.\n",
    "  - `2|1`: Page 2 must come before page 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Processing**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Indegrees:\n",
    "  - `indegree[1] = 1` (due to `2|1`)\n",
    "  - `indegree[2] = 1` (due to `1|2`)\n",
    "- Since there are no pages with `indegree` zero, the queue is empty from the start.\n",
    "- The `sorted_pages` list remains empty, indicating a cycle.\n",
    "- The function returns `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applying to Incorrect Updates\n",
    "\n",
    "In your problem, for updates that were originally incorrect:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Attempt to Reorder**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Use `topological_sort()` to try to find a valid order that satisfies all the ordering rules for the pages in the update.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sum Middle Pages of Reordered Updates**:\n",
    "  - If reordering is successful, calculate the middle page of the reordered update and add it to your total.\n",
    "  - If reordering isn't possible (due to cycles), the update is skipped, as it can't be corrected without violating the rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Topological Sorting?\n",
    "\n",
    "Topological sorting allows us to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Find a Valid Order**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - It rearranges the pages to respect all dependencies (ordering rules).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Detect Impossible Cases**:\n",
    "  - If dependencies conflict (cycles), it identifies that reordering is impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The `topological_sort()` function is essential for reordering the incorrect updates so they become valid according to the rules. By understanding that it constructs a dependency graph and orders the pages while respecting these dependencies, you can see how it reorganizes the pages to meet the constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Nodes**: Pages in the update.\n",
    "- **Edges**: Ordering rules (X must come before Y).\n",
    "- **Indegree**: The number of dependencies a page has.\n",
    "- **Queue**: Starts with pages that have no dependencies.\n",
    "- **Processing**: Remove pages with no dependencies and reduce the indegrees of dependent pages.\n",
    "- **Cycle Detection**: If we can't process all pages, there's a cycle (conflict).\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope this clarifies how the `topological_sort()` function works! Let me know if you have any more questions.\n"
