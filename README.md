# Advent-of-Code
My personal repo where I save my (poor) code for Advent of Code (AoC).
For version control, and because I think it can be fun, I'll try to save/write down my setup and how I (try to) solve the puzzles.

## 2024
***
First year joining in, got peer-pressured, not sure how much time I have.
### Setup
VSCode + Python notebooks
@TODO: don't be an ass and just copy paste common functions in each notebook. Store them in a `.py`.
Thanks,
your future self

### Template
Copy the template resources in a new folder
```
cp -a 2024/template/. 2024/<new_day_number>
```
